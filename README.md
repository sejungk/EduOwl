# EduOwl
EduOwl is an innovative tool designed to simplify the university admissions process and assist students in finding a major that aligns with their passions and strengths. The application features an AI-driven chat interface for inquiries about Rowan University, coupled with a major recommendation system that evaluates students' interests, strengths, and career goals to suggest suitable majors.

## How It Works

### 1. University Admissions Guidance
EduOwl's chat interface provides an engaging and informative user experience, guiding students through various aspects of Rowan University, including academics, campus life, and admission requirements.

### 2. Major Recommendation System
Recognizing the importance of selecting the right major, EduOwl evaluates students' unique characteristics and career goals. It then suggests suitable majors, streamlining the critical decision-making process.

## How We Built It

Building EduOwl involved meticulous gathering of the latest admission information from Rowan University's official website using Python and web scraping techniques. The development of the EduOwl chatbot incorporated PyPDF2 for extracting text from PDF documents and OpenAI's language models powered by LangChain for an effective conversation management system.
